# CS-PowerBI-Londons-Airbnb
Airbnb London Listings Dashboard (Power BI) developed for Cambridge Spark as part of the Data Analytics Portfolio.

## Introduction: ##
- Gain insights into the number of Airbnb properties in London, main locations, availability throughout the year, property types, and reviews.
- Analyse the database to address the interests of property owners and discuss the impact of this burgeoning market on housing accessibility in one of the most prestigious cities. This case study exemplifies trends observed in other cities as well.
- The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle: Airbnb in London Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/learning-about-airbnb-in-london-through-this-dat/data), covering Airbnb property data from 2009 to 2019.

## Problems and Solutions: ##

**Updating listing prices**
- Explore the relationship between the price per listing and its duration on Airbnb. There is a slight correlation, with longer availability offering more flexibility to customers.
- Investigate the relationship between reviews per month and the calculated host listings count. No direct correlation is found, suggesting that repeat bookings may impact review frequency.
- Determine the most popular month for Airbnb bookings based on the number of reviews. June (Spring) emerges as the peak month for visitors.

**Potential Data Use**
- Utilize Power BI to enable property searches based on customer preferences. Create slicers for Borough, Room Type, Price Range, and the number of nights customers plan to stay in London.

**Housing exclusion**
- Identify the locations with the highest concentration of Airbnb properties. Primarily in Westminster Borough, likely due to its proximity to popular attractions. Consider the impact of high living costs on residents' housing choices.
- Explore the number of properties dedicated exclusively to Airbnb use and categorize them by room type. The dataset indicates 1952 listings exclusively for Airbnb and most of them are private rooms.

## Conclusion: ## 
- The visualisation tool Power BI is very powerful to extract insights almost instantly and it is very easy to use once the data is clean and validated.
- Understanding the context of the dataset that will be analysed is crucial to draw conclusions and make decisions or suggest changes with your client. In this example it is possible to be more specific and filter the analysis for a specific borough and room type.

## Next steps: ##
- The dataset covers the Airbnb listings before the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be interesting to see how it changed until this year, 2024. The impact of Brexit, imigration enforcement, the cost of living crisis, the opening of the Elisabeth Line are important to consider in the further analysis.
